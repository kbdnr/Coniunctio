# Coniunctio
Code snippets and saves from the latest album [Coniuntio](https://unifactor.bandcamp.com/album/coniunctio)

## EXP-Series
Four of the album tracks are titled 'exp x' and were originally slated for a release with Experimedia.  Most of these tracks are sparce were designed to pair with audio-visual performances with [REW](https://vimeo.com/rewmedia).  My favorite of these tracks (the four found on the album) have been making appearances in Spednar live sets for a while.  Included is code related to the original tracks.

Most of these tracks were originally written for tidal 0.8 which the syntax reflects.

## VoV 11 Tracks
Two of the tracks 'bayz0ne' and 'enhance' were made for performaning at Voice of the Valley 11 in WV.  An original recording of the live set can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/368163681).  Immediately after this set the idea for the Unifactor release came into existence.

## Ambient/B-Side Tracks
The longform ambient tracks 'aut' and 'unititled' were originally paired as part of an ambient release - but the idea of doing a fully ambient release seems kind of overdone in 2020 and easily forgettable. 

'aut' is based on the included stringamb_xxx Pd patch which uses [automatonism](https://www.automatonism.com/) objects.  Midi output was uses for secondary synthesis.  {arsonist} violin solo was recorded as a single take.

'unititled' was originally created while making control change tidal configs for the blofeld.  All original synthesis is done on the blofeld and later reprocessed with various VSTs and effects.
